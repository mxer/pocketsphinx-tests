# Pocketsphinx Tests

Run these with `python3 <scriptname>.py`; they probably won't work with
Python 2. `pocketsphinx-python` is required. Install it with `pip3 install
pocketsphinx`.

`pocketsphinx-python` depends on PocketSphinx (duh) and PulseAudio. On
Debian, the packages `libpocketsphinx-dev` and `libpulse-dev` should be
installed before pip installation.
